                <br />
                <p>Music Blocks is a programming environment for children interested in
                    music and graphics. It expands upon Turtle Blocks in that it has a
                    collection of features relating to pitch and rhythm.
                </p>
                <p>The Turtle Blocks guide is a good place to start learning about the
                    basics. In this guide, we illustrate the music features walking the
                    reader through numerous examples.
                </p>
                <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
                <p>Music Blocks is designed to run in a browser. Most of the development
                    has been done in Chrome, but it should also work in Firefox (although
                    you may need to disable hardware acceleration). You can run it from
                    the <a href="http://rawgit.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/index.html">github
                    repo</a> or
                    <a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks">github io</a> or by
                    downloading a copy of the code and running directly from the file
                    system of your computer. (Note that the <a href="https://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/archive/offline.zip">off-line
                    branch</a>
                    is optimized to run on systems without internet access.)

                <h2 id="the-pitch-time-matrix">THE PITCH-TIME MATRIX</h2>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix1.svg'</img></p>
                <p>Music Blocks provides a widget, the Pitch-time Matrix, as a scaffold
                    for getting started.
                </p>
                <p>Once you've launched Music Blocks in your browser, start by clicking
                    on the Pitch-time Matrix stack that appears in the middle of the
                    screen. (For the moment, ignore the Start block.) You'll see a grid
                    organized vertically by pitch and horizontally by rhythm.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix2.svg'</img></p>
                <p>The default matrix has five pitch blocks, hence, you will see five rows,
                    one for each pitch. (A sixth row at the bottom is used for specifying
                    the rhythms associated with each note.)
                </p>
                <p>Also by default, there are two Rhythm blocks, which specifies six
                    quarter notes followed by one half note. Since the Rhythm blocks are
                    inside of a Repeat block, there are fourteen (2 x 7) columns for
                    selecting notes.
                </p>
                <p>Note that the matrix in the figure above has three Pitch blocks and
                    one Rhythm block, which is used to create a 3 x 3 grid of pitch and
                    time.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix3.svg'</img></p>
                <p>By clicking on individual cells in the grid, you should hear
                    individual notes (or chords if you click on more than one cell in a
                    column). In the figure, three quarter notes are selected (black
                    cells). First Re 4 (D4), followed by Mi 4 (E4), followed by Sol 4
                    (G4).
                </p>
                <p><img
                    src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/play-button.svg'
                    height="36"</img> If you click on the Play button (found in the top
                    row of the grid), you will hear a sequence of notes played (from left
                    to right): D4 E4 G4.
                </p>
                <p><img

                    height="36"</img> Once you have a group of notes (a "chunk") that you
                    like, click on the Save button (just to the right of the Play
                    button). This will create a stack of blocks that can used to play
                    these same notes programmatically. (More on that below.)
                </p>
                <p>You can rearrange the selected notes in the grid and safe other chunks
                    as well.
                </p>
                <p><img
                    src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/close-button.svg'
                    height="36"</img> Or hide the grid by clicking on the Close button
                    (the right-most button in the top row of the grid.)
                </p>
                <p><img
                    src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/erase-button.svg'
                    height="36"</img> There is also an Erase button that will clear the
                    grid.
                </p>
                <p>Don't worry. You can reopen the grid at anytime and since you can
                    define as many chunks as you want, feel free to experiment.
                </p>
                <p>Tip: You can put a chunk inside a Pitch-time Matrix block to generate
                    the matrix to corresponds to that chunk.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix4.svg'</img></p>
                <p>The chunk created when you click on the matrix is a stack of
                    blocks. The blocks are nested: an Action block contains three Note
                    blocks, each of which contains a Pitch block. The Action block has a
                    name automatically generated by the matrix, in this case, chunk. (You
                    can rename the action by clicking on the name.). Each note has a
                    duration (in this case 4, which represents a quarter note). Try
                    putting different numbers in and see (hear) what happens. Each note
                    block also has a pitch block (if it were a chord, there would be
                    multiple pitch blocks nested inside the Note block's clamp). Each
                    pitch block has a pitch name (Re, Mi, and Sol), and a pitch octave; in
                    this example, the octave is 4 for each pitch. (Try changing the pitch
                    names and the pitch octaves.)
                </p>
                <p>To play the chuck, simply click on the action block (on the word
                    action). You should hear the notes play, ordered from top to bottom.
                </p>
                <h2 id="about-the-pitch-block">About the Pitch Block</h2>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix5.svg'</img></p>
                <p>As we have seen, Pitch blocks are used inside the Pitch-time
                    Matrix block to indicate pitches you may want to select. They are also
                    used inside of Note blocks to specify the pitch(s) to be played when
                    the Note block is run.
                </p>
                <p>You can plug different values into the Pitch block name and octave
                    slots. Some examples are shown above. Starting from the top, the pitch
                    name block is specified using a Solfege block; the pitch name is
                    specified using a Pitch-name block; the pitch name is specified using
                    a Number block (frequency in Hertz); the pitch name is specified using
                    a Text block.
                </p>
                <p>The octave is specified using a number block and is restricted to
                    whole numbers. In the case where the pitch name is specified by
                    frequency, the octave is ignored.
                </p>
                <h2 id="about-the-rhythm-block">About the Rhythm Block</h2>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix6.svg'</img></p>
                <p>Rhythm blocks are used to generate rhythm patterns in the
                    Pitch-time Matrix. The top argument to the Rhythm block is the
                    number of notes. The bottom argument is the duration of the note. In
                    the top example above, three columns for quarter notes would be
                    generated in the grid. In the middle example, one column for an eighth
                    note would be generated. In the bottom example, seven columns for 16th
                    notes would be generated.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix7.svg'</img></p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix8.svg'</img></p>
                <p>You can use as many Rhythm blocks as you'd like inside the
                    Pitch-time Matrix block. In the above example, two Rhythm
                    blocks are used, resulting in three quarter notes and six eighth
                    notes.
                </p>
                <h2 id="creating-tuplets">Creating Tuplets</h2>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix9.svg'</img></p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix10.svg'</img></p>
                <p>Tuplets are a collection of notes that get scaled to a specific
                    duration. Using tuplets makes it easy to create groups of notes that
                    are not based on a power of 2. In the example above, three quarter
                    notes -- defined in the Rhythm block -- are played in the time of a
                    single quarter note. The result is three twelfth notes.
                </p>
                <p>You can mix and match Rhythm blocks and Tuplets when defining your
                    grid.
                </p>
                <h2 id="using-individual-notes-in-the-matrix">Using individual notes in the matrix</h2>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix11.svg'</img></p>
                <p>You can also use individual notes when defining the grid. These blocks
                    will expand into rhythm blocks with corresponding values.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/silence.svg'</img></p>
                <p>A Silence block can be used in combination with the Note block to
                    create "rests".
                </p>
                <h2 id="programming-with-music">PROGRAMMING WITH MUSIC</h2>
                <p>The remainder of this guide discusses how to use the chunks created by
                    the Pitch-time Matrix when programming (You can also program with
                    chunks you create and/or modify by hand).
                </p>
                <h2 id="1-a-chunk-of-notes">1. A chunk of notes</h2>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix4.svg'</img></p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk1.svg'</img></p>
                <p>Every time you create a new stack, Music Blocks creates a new block
                    specific to that stack. (The new block is found at the bottom of the
                    Block palette, found on the left edge of the screen.) Clicking on this
                    block is the same as clicking on your stack. In the example above, the
                    chunk block is inside of a Start block, which ties it to the Run
                    button in the upper-left corner of the screen (the Rabbit button). Try
                    clicking on the Run button. Also try the Run Slow button (the Turtle).
                </p>

                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk3.svg'</img></p>
                <p>You can repeat chunks either by using multiple chunk blocks or using a
                    Repeat block.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk4.svg'</img></p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk5.svg'</img></p>
                <p>You can also mix and match chunks. Here we play chunk, followed by chunk1 twice, and then chunk again.</p>

                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk7.svg'</img></p>
                <p>A few more chunks and we can make a song. (Can you read the block notation in order to guess what song we've programmed?)</p>
                <h2 id="2-transformations">2. Transformations</h2>
                <p>There are many ways to transform pitch, rhythm, and other qualities of
                    the sound.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform1.svg'</img></p>
                <p>The Sharp and Flat blocks can be wrapped around Pitch blocks, Note
                    blocks, or chunks. A sharp will raise the pitch by one half step. A
                    flat will lower by one half step. In the example, on the left, just
                    the Pitch block Mi is lowered by one half step; on the right, both
                    pitch blocks are raised by one half step.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform2.svg'</img></p>
                <p>The Transposition block can be used to make larger shifts in pitch. To
                    shift an entire octave, transpose by 12 half-steps up. -12 will shift
                    an octave down.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform3.svg'</img></p>
                <p>In the example above, we take the song we programmed previously and raise it by one octave.</p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform4.svg'</img></p>
                <p>You can "dot" notes using the Dot block. A dotted note extends by
                    50%. E.g., a dotted quarter note will play for 3/8 of a beat. A dotted
                    eighth note will play for 3/16 of a beat.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform5.svg'</img></p>
                <p>You can also multiply (or divide) the beat factor, which will speed up
                    or slowdown the notes.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform6.svg'</img></p>
                <p>There are several ways to repeat notes. The Repeat block will play a
                    sequence of notes multiple times; the Duplicate block will repeat each
                    note in a sequence.
                </p>
                <p>In the example, on the left, the result would be Sol, Re, Sol, Sol,
                    Re, Sol, Sol, Re, Sol, Sol, Re, Sol; on the right the result would be
                    Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol, Re, Re, Re, Re, Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol.
                </p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform7.svg'</img></p>
                <p>Swing works on pairs of notes, adding some duration to the first note
                    and taking the same amount from the second note.
                </p>
                <p>Tie also works on pairs of notes, combining them into one note. (The
                    notes must be identical in pitch, but can vary in rhythm.)

                <p>Set volume will change the volume of the notes. The default is 50; the
                    range is 0 (silence) to 100 (full volume).
                </p>
                <p>Crescendo will increase (or decrease) the volume of the contained
                    notes by an amount specified.
                </p>
                <p>Staccato will play back notes in tight bursts while maintaining the
                    specified rhymic value of the notes.
                </p>
                <p>Slur will run a note past its noted duration, blending it into the
                    next note.
                </p>
                <p>Other Tone Palette blocks include Articulation, which
                changes the volume of a group of notes, and a set of interval blocks,
                Fifths, Tritone, Fourths, and Thirds, which calculate and add pitches
                at common intervals.

                <h2 id="3-voices">3. Voices</h2>
                <p>Each Start block runs as a separate voice in Music blocks. (When you
                    click on the Run button, all of the Start blocks are run
                    concurrently.)

                <p>...we can run it from multiple Start blocks.</p>

                <p>It gets more interesting if we shift up and down octaves.</p>
                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices4.svg'</img></p>
                <p>And even more interesting if we bring the various voices offset in time.</p>

                <p>We can also launch the phrases (chunks) interactively. In this case,
                    when the mouse is in the lower-left quadrant, <code>chunk</code> is played;
                    lower-right quadrant, <code>chunk1</code>; upper-left quadrant, <code>chunk2</code>; and
                    upper-right quadrant, <code>chunk3</code>.

                <p>Turtle graphics can be combined with the music blocks. By placing
                    graphics blocks, e.g., Forward and Right, inside of Note blocks, the graphics
                    stay in sync with the music. In this example, the turtle moves forward each time a quarter note is played. It turns right during the eighth note. The pitch is
                    raised by one half step, the pen size decreases, and the pen color
                    increases at each step in the inner repeat loop.

                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics3.svg'</img></p>
                <p>In this example, the graphics are synchronized to the music by placing
                    the graphics commands inside of note blocks.

                <p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/fibonacci3.svg'</img></p>
                <p>In this example, because the computation and graphics are more
                    complex, a Free-time block is used to decouple the graphics from the
                    master clock.
